Rittai Kidou is my first game ever made!

Created in Unity and coded in Visual Studio 2022

Check out the game's code [here](https://github.com/Nathan-Amiri/Rittai-Kidou/tree/main/Assets/Scripts)

Rittai Kidou uses FishNet as its networking solution, as well as Unity's multiplayer servers.
These two services have compatibility issues, and so I migrated to a new networking solution for future projects.
As a result, the networking code in this project is generally inefficient in comparison to my newer projects.
